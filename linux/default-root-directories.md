# Quick meaning of the default Linux/Unix root directories

If you have ever worked with a terminal for a Linux or Unix based operating system, you may have noticed that there are several 'standard' directories located in the root directory. The following directories are the default root directories that are present in nearly every Linux/Unix-like distribution; they are created automatically during the initial installation of the operating system. It is helpful to know their purposes.

⦁	bin: where program binaries are stored

⦁	etc: system-wide config files

⦁	home: where users keep their own files

⦁	lib: shared code and kernel libraries. lib is short for "library"

⦁	root: where the system administrator keeps their files

⦁	usr: shared, read-only files; includes binaries and documentation

⦁	var: for items/files that change frequently, such as logs, printer spools, and some caches. var is short for "variable"

I discovered the meanings of these directories whilst going through the LNX1 challenge for IBM Z Xplore. Interested in knowing about what that is? IBM Z Xplore is a free, hands-on learning program that introduces students to mainframe skills and concepts. Check it out here: https://www.ibm.com/products/z/resources/zxplore

Bonus:
Did you know that 'sudo' stands for "Super User Do"?
